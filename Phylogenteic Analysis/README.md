# Pylogenetic Analysis

Given an input matrix, Proj3_UPGMA.py computes a upgma tree in a format identical to the phylip phylogenies platform created by 
Joe Felsenstein of the Department of Genome Sciences and the Department of Biology at the University of Washington, specifying
pairs of nodes and their heights e.g. (a, (b,c, .5), .9)

Proj3_nj.py takes an input matrix and outputs a neighbor joining tree with pairs of artificial and concrete nodes along with their distance.
