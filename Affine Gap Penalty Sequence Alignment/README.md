# Affine Gap Penalty Sequence Alignment

## Overview
This algorithm is adapted, in part, from An Introduction to BioInformatics: Neil C Jones and Pavel A. Pevzner, Chapter 6 (dynamic
programming). While purposed for finding the optimal Alignment between two sequences, sentences from any natural language are 
also optimally aligned.

Results from the alignment of genomes within the file finalcompare.fasta have been written to the GenomeAndFirstGene.fasta file
and GenomeAndSecondGene.fasta file. 

## Usage
* the program project_2_final.py reads in all sequences within a fasta file and generates a menu to choose seqences for alignment
* after alignment the user is prompted to enter a name for the fasta file in which the alingment data will be written.
